You don't need to install this CLI, but to install its dependencies. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all packages it needs.

That's it!

### Usage

1. Write your slides in a markdown file
2. Remember, '---' is the signal for a new slide
3. Run `python givemeslides.py <your file name> > <your file name>.html` to generate slides file
4. That's it. You got a .html file now, view it with your favourite browser, not IE. LOL, have fun!
