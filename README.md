====================

It's based on Google's html5slides project, we add markdown support for it.

### What is Google's html5slides project?

Please visit \[http://code.google.com/p/html5slides/](http://code.google.com/p/html5slides/) to get more info about this project.

### Installation

Run `sudo python setup.py install` to install it.

That's it!

### Usage

1. Write your slides in a markdown file
2. Remember, '---' is the signal for a new slide
